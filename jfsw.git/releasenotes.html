	<h1>Release Notes for JFShadowWarrior</h1>
	<p>Release date: 10 March 2013</p>

	<h2>New Features and Improvements</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>The minimum supported Windows version is now XP. See below in <a href="#profiles">Individual
		User Profiles</a> for what this means to your configuration and savegames.</li>
		<li>Mac OS X version.</li>
	</ul>
		
	<h2>Known Issues</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Multiplayer is not fully functional yet. Peer-to-peer mode appears to work fine, but
		master-slave mode is broken and has been disabled for this release.</li>
		<li>There are two rendering bugs I am aware of that will be fixed in a subsequent release:
		<ol>
			<li>Level 1: the viewscreen to drive the silver key to the collection area is not working
			properly in GL Polymost mode, giving just a static texture. Switch to 8-bit mode
			temporarily to complete this section of the level.</li>
			<li>Level 2: in the pool of water at the end of the map which opens up a magic portal
			showing the next level, the sector-over-sector effect in the view beyond the portal
			malfunctions giving a shimmering sky area in the view.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ul>
		
	<h3><a name="install">Installation and Setup</a></h3>

	<p>After unzipping the package somewhere on your computer, you need to copy the SW.GRP file to where you
	extracted JFSW from either your original Shadow Warrior CD's <code>SWINST</code> directory or an existing
	installation of Shadow Warrior. SW.GRP contains all the game data necessary for running JFShadowWarrior.</p>

	<h3><a name="profiles">Individual User Profiles</a></h3>

	<p>Previous versions of this port supported old versions of Windows where storing game configuration and
	save data in the game directory along side the EXE and GRP files was accepted practice. Since Windows 9x, ME,
	and even XP are well beyond their supported life, I have switched the behaviour of this port to storing user-specific
	data in the user's profile directory. This directory can be found at:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>On Windows XP: <code>C:\Documents and Settings\<em>your username</em>\Application Data\JFDuke3D</code></li>
		<li>On Windows Vista/7/8: <code>C:\Users\<em>your username</em>\AppData\JFDuke3D</code></li>
	</ul>
	<p>If you are upgrading from an older version of this port, you may want to move your
	<code>duke3d.cfg</code> and <code>game<em>n</em>.sav</code> files to the appropriate new location.</p>
	
	<h3><a name="multiplayer">Multiplayer games</a></h3>

	<p>Multiplayer games are started via command-line parameters passed to SW.EXE. This is a short guide
	to getting a multiplayer game running between these three hypothetical computers:</p>
	<table class="center" border="1" rules="groups" cellpadding="2">
		<colgroup><col /></colgroup>
		<thead>
			<tr><th>Host name</th><th>IP address</th></tr>
		</thead>
		<tbody>
			<tr><td>faye</td><td>192.168.1.2</td></tr>
			<tr><td>asuka</td><td>192.168.1.5</td></tr>
			<tr><td>kaoru</td><td>192.168.1.6</td></tr>
		</tbody>
	</table>
	<p><span class="warning">PLEASE NOTE: Master-slave mode is currently disabled in JFShadowWarrior until it is
	fixed. Peer-to-peer mode however should be fine.</span> The basic syntax of the network command
	line is like so: <code>SW <em>(normal game parameters)</em> /net <em>(network parameters)</em></code></p>
	<table border="1" rules="cols" cellpadding="2" class="center">
		<caption>Network parameters</caption>
		<colgroup>
			<col valign="top" />
		</colgroup>
		<tr>
			<td>/nx:y</td>
			<td>Game comm type. <em>x</em> = 0 for master/slave or 1 for peer-to-peer.<br />
				If unspecified, <em>y</em> defaults to 2. For more than two players in a
				master-slave game, you have to indicate the number on the <em>master</em>.
				eg: /n0 or /n0:4</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>/px</td>
			<td>Overrides the default port (23513) with <em>x</em> being the new port value.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>address:port</td>
			<td>An address of a machine. See the items below for more information.</td>
		</tr>
	</table>

	<h4>Master/Slave mode (disabled at present)</h4>
	<p>This mode is the easiest mode for use with Internet play since it requires only the address of the master
	of the game (the person hosting the game) be specified by each slave who joins. Here are example command
	lines each machine must run to join the game hosted by the machine named 'asuka':
	</p>
	<table border="1" rules="cols" cellpadding="2">
		<tr><td>asuka</td><td><code>SW.EXE /net /n0:3</code></td></tr>
		<tr><td>faye</td><td><code>SW.EXE /net /n0 192.168.1.5</code></td></tr>
		<tr><td>kaoru</td><td><code>SW.EXE /net /n0 192.168.1.5</code></td></tr>
	</table>

	<h4>Peer-to-peer mode</h4>
	<p>This mode is often useful for playing on a LAN where it is easier to coordinate and organise the order of
	peers in the game. This mode will become simpler to set up in the future but for now this is how to do
	it. Peer-to-peer mode requires each machine specify the addresses of each other machine in the game in the
	same order, but indicating its own position in the sequence with the <code>/n1</code> option.</p>
	<table border="1" rules="cols" cellpadding="2">
		<tr><td>asuka</td><td><code>SW.EXE /net /n1 192.168.1.2 192.168.1.6</code></td></tr>
		<tr><td>faye</td><td><code>SW.EXE /net 192.168.1.5 /n1 192.168.1.6</code></td></tr>
		<tr><td>kaoru</td><td><code>SW.EXE /net 192.168.1.5 192.168.1.2 /n1</code></td></tr>
	</table>

	<h4>Addresses and ports</h4>
	<p>The networking code is capable of resolving WINS host names (on Windows) and DNS names to their
	corresponding addresses, so if your network is configured with such services, instead of having to specify
	raw IP addresses, you can give the computer's WINS host name or a DNS host name.</p>
	<p>The default port the game communicates on is 23513. Some users may find it necessary to set up a
	forward through their Internet firewall in order to get games working when playing across the Internet.
	You can override the default port via the <code>/p<em>???</em></code> switch where <em>???</em> is the new
	port number. If a master is running a game on a port other than the default, the slaves will have to
	specify the alternative port with <code>address:port</code> notation, eg. 192.168.1.5:20000</p>

	<h2><a name="savegames">Save Help</a></h2>

	<p>I have written a new compiler and system-independent framework for saving and restoring the pointer
	information contained in Shadow Warrior's internal objects, and this has required a large amount of manual
	processing of the source code to pick out the data and functions in the game that need to be saved to disk.
	Because of this, I have quite likely missed some functions or data that are on a rare occasion required to
	properly save a game. If this happens, you will see a message after the save operation that reads:</p>
	<pre>There was a problem saving. See "Save Help" section of release notes.</pre>
	<p>When this message is displayed, the game creates a file named <code>savegame symbols missing.txt</code>
	in the game directory containing information I require to be able to add the missing symbols into the game
	code for future saves. If you see the message, please send the file to me at <a
	href="mailto:jf@jonof.id.au">jf@jonof.id.au</a> so I may update the game.</p>

	<h2><a name="customfile">Customisation File Format</a></h2>

	<p>Historically, the modifications and total conversions for Shadow Warrior have been forced to resort to
	hacking the game executable with a hex editor to replace the names of maps and the episode title
	information. For this port I have introduced a customisation script file that is loaded on startup which
	achieves the same purpose as the EXE hacks once did. Customisation of weapon ammunition counts and other
	similar things will be added in the future as the need arises.</p>

	<p>The customisation file should be named <code>SWCUSTOM.TXT</code> for the game to find it. The contents
	of the file may consist of these directives. Comments can be used by prefixing the text with a double
	forward-slash (C++ style), <code>//</code>, or surrounding the text with <code>/*</code> <em>(comment
	here)</em> <code>*/</code> (C style).</p>

	<h2><a name="deffile">DEF-file Language</a></h2>

	<p>Documentation of the DEF file language can now be found on <a
		href="http://www.jonof.id.au/jfbuild.def">my website</a> as the information there is
	common to all JFBuild-based ports.</p>

	<h2><a name="maphack">Map Hack scripts</a></h2>

	<p>"Map Hack" scripts are files that override certain aspects of a map file when it is rendered in OpenGL
	Polymost mode. Currently they allow for angle adjustment on sprites, and the ability to prevent particular
	sprites from being drawn as a model. These are useful for making small corrections to ornamental sprites in
	a way that doesn't require modifying the original map.</p>
	<p>The game will automatically load a map hack script whenever a map is loaded. The script should have the
	same base name as the original .MAP file, but with an .MHK extension. The map hack language is described
	below. It uses the same parser as DEF files, so you can use comments in the same way.</p>

	<dl>
		<dt>sprite <em>number</em></dt>
		<dd>Begins a sprite definition. <em>number</em> is the sprite number to affect. You can find this in
		the Build editor by highlighting the sprite in 2D mode and pressing Control+Tab. The next group of
		commands describe the changes to make to the sprite.
		<dl>
			<dt>notmd<br />
			notmd2<br />
			notmd3</dt>
			<dd>Prevents the sprite from being drawn as a model. It gets drawn as a regular sprite
			instead. <strong>notmd2</strong> and <strong>notmd3</strong> are synonyms for
			<strong>notmd</strong>.</dd>

			<dt>nomdanim<br />
			nomd2anim<br />
			nomd3anim</dt>
			<dd>Prevents model animation from playing if the sprite is being drawn as a model.
			<strong>nomd2anim</strong> and <strong>nomd3anim</strong> are synonyms for
			<strong>nomdanim</strong>.</dd>

			<dt>angleoff <em>angle</em><br />
			angoff <em>angle</em></dt>
			<dd>Adds <em>angle</em> to the angle of the sprite just before it is rendered. This is good
			for fixing up things like toilet sprites that are facing the wrong way.
			<strong>angoff</strong> is a synonym for <strong>angleoff</strong>.</dd>
		</dl></dd>

	<h2><a name="hightile">Hightile</a></h2>

	<p>This release features the "Hightile" texturing improvements to Polymost. Hightile allows Polymost to use
	true-colour textures instead of the artwork in the game's usual .ART file.</p>
	<p>Replacement textures can be saved as JPEG, PNG (alpha channel supported), TGA, BMP, CEL, GIF, and PCX
	formats. Hightile uses Ken Silverman's picture library to provide rapid picture file loading.</p>
	<p>Hightile textures are defined in the SW.DEF file. See the <a href="#deffile">DEF-file language</a>
	reference for information on how to specify Hightile textures.</p>
	
	<h3>Limitations to Hightile</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Hightile will squash or stretch the replacement to fit in the dimensions of the original tile
		it replaces. Artists should keep their replacements in the same ratio as the original tile for the
		art to not look distorted.</li>
	</ul>
	<h2><a name="hightile-zip">Extra GRP and ZIP file support</a></h2>

	<p>JFShadowWarrior (and JFBuild games in general) can load extra game resources from a GRP or ZIP file.</p>
	<p>Use the "/g" command-line switch to specify the ZIP or GRP to load. eg. <code>SW.EXE /gMYFILE.ZIP</code></p>

	<h2><a name="polymost">Polymost</a></h2>

	<p>Polymost is a full 3D implementation of the Build engine renderer, with hardware acceleration capability,
	and perspective in six degrees of freedom. In Ken's own words (copied from POLYMOST.C in my Build engine
	source distribution):</p>
	<pre>
"POLYMOST" code written by Ken Silverman
Ken Silverman's official web site: http://www.advsys.net/ken

Motivation:
When 3D Realms released the Duke Nukem 3D source code, I thought somebody would do a OpenGL or
Direct3D port. Well, after a few months passed, I saw no sign of somebody working on a true
hardware-accelerated port of Build, just people saying it wasn't possible. Eventually, I realized
the only way this was going to happen was for me to do it myself. First, I needed to port Build to
Windows. I could have done it myself, but instead I thought I'd ask my Australian buddy, Jonathon
Fowler, if he would upgrade his Windows port to my favorite compiler (MSVC) - which he did. Once
that was done, I was ready to start the "POLYMOST" project.

About:
This source file is basically a complete rewrite of the entire rendering part of the Build engine.
There are small pieces in ENGINE.C to activate this code, and other minor hacks in other source
files, but most of it is in here. If you're looking for polymost-related code in the other source
files, you should find most of them by searching for either "polymost" or "rendmode". Speaking of
rendmode, there are now 4 rendering modes in Build:

    rendmode 0: The original code I wrote from 1993-1997
    rendmode 1: Solid-color rendering: my debug code before I did texture mapping
    rendmode 2: Software rendering before I started the OpenGL code (Note: this is just a quick
                hack to make testing easier - it's not optimized to my usual standards!)
    rendmode 3: The OpenGL code

The original Build engine did hidden surface removal by using a vertical span buffer on the tops
and bottoms of walls. This worked nice back in the day, but it it's not suitable for a polygon
engine. So I decided to write a brand new hidden surface removal algorithm - using the same idea
as the original Build - but one that worked with vectors instead of already rasterized data.
	</pre>
	<p>Polymost is the default renderer choice for any video mode with a colour depth greater than 256
	colours.</p>
	<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> If your computer does not have an OpenGL graphics card, Polymost in OpenGL mode
	will most likely use the default Windows OpenGL rasterising facility which does all rendering in software.
	This may be extremely slow. If your Windows installation doesn't have any form of OpenGL rendering ability,
	Polymost will probably crash.</p>
	<p><strong>NOTE 2:</strong> OpenGL Polymost has been tested on an nVidia Riva TNT 16MB, an nVidia GeForce2
	GTS 32MB, an nVidia GeForce4 Ti4600 128MB, an nVidia GeForce 6800GT 256MB, an ATi Radeon Mobility 9000 64MB,

	<h2>Console Commands</h2>

	<p>This is a list of console commands and variables and their purpose:</p>

	<dl>
		<dt>dumpbuildinfo</dt>
		<dd>Displays the compilation information for the game when it was built.</dd>

		<dt>echo &lt;text...&gt;</dt>
		<dd>Displays to the console what is passed as parameters to the command.</dd>

		<dt>fileinfo &lt;filename&gt;</dt>
		<dd>Displays some information about a given file, eg. size, CRC-32 checksum.</dd>

		<dt>glinfo</dt>
		<dd>Displays some information about the OpenGL driver.</dd>

		<dt>glredbluemode &lt;0 or 1&gt;</dt>
		<dd>Enables or disables the red-blue stereovision mode in OpenGL. This mode is experimental
		at this time. We know the flicker is nasty and the menu background will mix into the screen.
		To avoid the menu bug, run the game in fullscreen mode and type "glredbluemode 1" AFTER
		beginning the game. Sorry, there is no way to change parallax or separation. Do not contact
		us about bugs with this mode... if you do, we'll think twice about documenting hidden features
		in future releases. :P</dd>

		<dt>gltextureanisotropy &lt;level&gt;</dt>
		<dd>Sets the OpenGL anisotropic filtering level.</dd>

		<dt>gltexturemode &lt;mode-number&gt;</dt>
		<dd>Sets the OpenGL texturing mode. Valid values are:
		<table class="center" cellpadding="2" rules="cols" border="1">
			<tr><td>0</td><td>GL_NEAREST (looks rather like the original software renderer)</td></tr>
			<tr><td>1</td><td>GL_LINEAR</td></tr>
			<tr><td>2</td><td>GL_NEAREST_MIPMAP_NEAREST</td></tr>
			<tr><td>3</td><td>GL_LINEAR_MIPMAP_NEAREST (bilinear)</td></tr>
			<tr><td>4</td><td>GL_NEAREST_MIPMAP_LINEAR</td></tr>
			<tr><td>5</td><td>GL_LINEAR_MIPMAP_LINEAR (trilinear)</td></tr>
		</table></dd>

		<dt>glusetexcompr &lt;0 or 1&gt;</dt>
		<dd>Enables or disables the use of OpenGL texture compression for hightile textures. You need
		to use 'restartvid' to apply any changes to this value.</dd>

		<dt>help &lt;name&gt;</dt>
		<dd>Displays a help message for a particular console variable or command.</dd>

		<dt>listsymbols</dt>
		<dd>Displays the names of all commands and variables available in the console.</dd>

		<dt>novoxmips &lt;0 or 1&gt;</dt>
		<dd>Disables or enables the use of voxel mipmaps to improve voxel visual quality.</dd>

		<dt>osdrows &lt;num&gt;</dt>
		<dd>Sets the number of visible lines of the console when it is open.</dd>

		<dt>screencaptureformat &lt;0 or 1&gt;</dt>
		<dd>0 = Targa, 1 = PCX</dd>

		<dt>setrendermode &lt;mode&gt;</dt>
		<dd>Sets the current Polymost render mode.</dd>

		<dt>usegoodalpha &lt;0 or 1&gt;</dt>
		<dd>If 1, a lower alpha cutoff value is used when rendering textures with transparency, which
		gives better looking transparent textures at the expense of some sprites behind the transparent
		item potentially being invisible in certain circumstances. 0 is a more compatible value (and is
		the default) for this option but slight visual degradation will result.</dd>

		<dt>usehightile &lt;0 or 1&gt;</dt>
		<dd>Disables or enables the use of Hightile textures in GL Polymost mode if any are defined.</dd>

		<dt>usemodels &lt;0 or 1&gt;</dt>
		<dd>Disables or enables the use of 3D models in GL Polymost mode if any are defined.</dd>

		<dt>usevoxels &lt;0 or 1&gt;</dt>
		<dd>Disables or enables the use of voxels in the classic renderer if any are defined.</dd>
