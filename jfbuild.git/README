Build Engine Port by Jonathon Fowler
====================================
with contributions by Ken Silverman

 * First Source Release: 9 March 2003
 * This Release: 10 March 2013
 * Email: jf@jonof.id.au
 * Website: http://www.jonof.id.au
 * Source code: http://github.com/jonof/jfbuild
 * Ken's site: http://www.advsys.net/ken

This is a release of the source code to my port of Ken Silverman's
Build game engine [1]. The port intends to bring the engine
up to speed so that it may be used more easily with modern operating
systems like Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X, Linux and BSD.


Configuration
-------------

Runtime settings for BUILD.EXE and GAME.EXE are set in build.cfg
and game.cfg respectively. These files are normal text files.  The
original SETUP.DAT that is used in Ken's original code is not used in
this port. The config files are automatically created on the first run of
the game or editor.


Building the Source
-------------------

I build the Windows binaries using the following tools and libraries:
 * MSYS ('Current' version) (http://www.mingw.org)
 * MinGW ('Current' version) (http://www.mingw.org)
 * NASM (http://nasm.sourceforge.net/)
 * DirectX 8.1 or above headers and import libraries
   - DX9: (http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=afc15f29-d7c9-4cf7-a8d5-8ab81f14ae1b&DisplayLang=en)
 * SDL 1.2 (http://www.libsdl.org/download-1.2.php)
   SDL is only used for the SDL interface layer and may be
   omitted if building the DirectX version.
 * FMOD (http://www.fmod.org)

Some good MinGW guides and whatnot:
 - http://www.libsdl.org/extras/win32/mingw32/README.txt
 - http://www.spacejack.org/games/mingw/

Building the source involves just typing "make" in the directory
where you have unpacked the source. Windows users should make sure the
directory structure in the ZIP is maintained on extraction. The default
interface layer on Windows is the DirectX interface. This can be overriden
to the SDL one by using the command "make RENDERTYPE=SDL" instead. Linux
and BSD builds will always use SDL.



Credits and Thanks
------------------
* Ken Silverman for his patience, help, and guidance in this. I
realise my rambling is taxing but your wisdom is invaluable.
* The folks at icculus.org for inspiring me to try and equal their
work done in the first public port of the engine.
* PÃ¤r Karlsson for his contributions


Enjoy!
